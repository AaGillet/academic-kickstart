The Belgian journal *Daily Science* interviewed me and wrote an article about our recent article published in the *Proceedings of the Royal Society B*.

You can read the full interview (in French) on their website: https://dailyscience.be/27/11/2019/les-cetaces-de-petite-taille-ont-casse-les-codes-ancestraux/

Our project was also featured on the University of Li√®ge website.
The article (in English) is available here: https://www.morfonct.uliege.be/cms/c_5387677/en/skeletons-valuable-clues-to-understanding-the-adaptation-of-marine-mammals-to-their-environment
